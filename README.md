# Neovim config for rojanDinc

## Setup
Run the setup scrip before using this config or else you'll get some errors
when running nvim.
```bash
./setup.sh
```

After the setup script start nvim you will get an error you can ignore it for now and run the command `:PackerInstall` and it will
install all plugins for you.
Thats it!
